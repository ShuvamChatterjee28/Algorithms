# Approach - 

Basically it is a problem just like the Coin Change. The difference is that in the coin change, we have given some arbitary coins to choose from and make a particular number, but here we have to take only perfect squares. That's it.

Rest it is just like Coin Change, make all the combinations in DP format using dp[0].

**Time Complexity: O(n^2)**
