# Below are the steps in short -

* We need to apply the Merge-Sort Algorithm
* First get the dividing points to divide the linked list
* Then divide the Linked List and divide recursicely
* Next merge two divided lists
* To merge, use the Merge method, which will merge two sorted lists and Return the head.

**Time Complexity: O(n * log n)**

**Space Complexity: O(log n)**
